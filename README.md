# The-Persevering-Path-of-the-US-Dollar-s-Value-Across-the-Last-Three-Presidencies
The first purpose of this project is to ascertain how the Euro to USD value fluctuated during the last three presidencies in the United States of America (as of January 2021). During 2007-2008, a huge economic recession had ocurred. In addition, this project aims to visually display the transition from that point in time. The second purpose of this project is to particularly improve data visualization skills.
